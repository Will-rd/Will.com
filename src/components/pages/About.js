      <p>
              My name is Will Putnam and I am a full stack web development graduate from Georgia Insitute of Technology <br />
      I have been working as a professional automotive technician for the past seven years and decided I wanted more from my career <br />
      I enrolled in the bootcamp provided by Georgia Tech and hit the ground running working on all sorts of apps and projects <br />
      that can be found in the project section of this webpage.
