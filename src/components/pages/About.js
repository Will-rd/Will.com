        My name is Will Putnam and I have worked as an automotive technician for the past seven years,<br />
        I wanted a career change that was easier on my body so I entered the Full stack web development<br />
        bootcamp at Georgia Tech, a full time 12 week fast paced course. I have since fallen in love with programming <br />
        and learning new skills to add to my portfolio. I specialize in the MERN stack, but I am currently learning <br />
        Golang and Python as well as the linux operating system. This website is currently still constantly under construction <br />
        as I complete more and more projects and or layout ideas on a regular basis.
